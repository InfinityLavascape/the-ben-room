hi

you may not know what the ben room is, let alone knowing what ben is.
it all started in 2017. when i was a kid, my family used to give me 2 plushie cats as keychains connected with suction cups meant for sticking them in stuff.
we didn't want just that. we wanted a cat
we ripped the keychain metal off
we ripped the mini suction cup off
now all we have is a plushie cat linked to a fabric hook.

that's where we named it ben and tyler.
ben was named after our piano teacher's suggestion (we were 2 brothers),
tyler was named my me.
in 2020-2021, a tragic happened.
i was stuck for 4 years trying to turn screen curtains off after unpairing my 0th gen apple watch
but most importantly,
i had the most stupidest idea in mind.
i accidentally threw tyler out the window
the frame caused it to bounce back
i said to henry: "hey dood look at this"
and thew tyler one more time
this time, he was off.
he flew away, stuck on a tree,
never to be reached again.

we have ben.
my mother wanted us to be happy!
she bought two more plushie cats.
now we have three
one in a blue shade (ben),
one in two shades of white (xen),
and one in a red shade (den),

den and xen?
around a year later, we put it in a box
my mother had mistaken it for trash
and threw it way,
never to be reached again.

ben?
we occasionally brought him to school
he had suffered a tragic fate the same as tyler's.
henry threw him up at a hallway,
the decoration had caught him,
he cannot be reached again,
but he was closer than any of the other cat's fates.
we had bought him back.

den and xen?
we had bought them back.

we now have 3 cats, again!
however, a miracle happened.
ben's old body in that hallway was retrieved and accurately found to us.
we had recalled tyler
and so he is ressurrected
we now have 4 cats again. the same amount that we have created from 2017 up to 2022-2023.

but now, we have a restriction.
my mother and my oldest brother (1st brother before us 2 were even born) promised,
we would never spend such money on such cats again.
that meant...
permanent extinction.

a tragedy happened,
and one never retrieved back.
1/15/2025,
den was brought to school,
but he disappeared,
never to be SEEN again.
den is dead.

we tried all sorts of comemoration and recallment,
on roblox we imported ben, den and xen as 3d models;
we made a ben shimeji;
we made shapes.inc ais for ben;
they were enough to satisfy me.
but shapes.inc was banned.

to make up for the ai part,
we had decided to make a website
a chatroom dedicated to these 4 cats,
in case they disappear,
all of their merchandises will remain on the active internet.
(please don't remove them.)
